This small program is used to control a modem via RS232. It is written in VB.NET and uses the .NET Framework 4. It is a Windows Forms application.

You can write AT commands to the modem and read the response directly in the Terminal field. You can also save the commands to a file.

I wrote the program because Windows 7 no longer has HyperTerminal. I needed a terminal to control a modem via RS232.

Lately, I have only updated it to newer .NET Frameworks. (Don't touch a running system :-) )

the .7z file contains the runnig Program and my Presets. You don't need to install anything. Just extract the .7z file and run the ModemController.exe file.
